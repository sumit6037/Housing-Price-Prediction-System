# Housing-Price-Prediction-System


# Project Summary

Use a test-driven approach to build a 
Linear Regression model using Python from scratch. In this project 
we will use your trained model to predict house sale prices.


The Objective of the Project is to use Linear Regression which is a Supervised Machine Learning Model for finding the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Linear regression performs the task to predict the response (dependent) variable value (y) 
based on a given (independent) explanatory variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y (output).

# Dataset Used

The dataset for the data analysis can be obtained via [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data). 


# Deployment/Demo

The project is live/deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed via this [link](https://housing-price-prediction-system.onrender.com)
